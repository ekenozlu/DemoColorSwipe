# DemoColorSwipe
In this demo app I created a simple game on Swift with Storyboard.

User have to swipe the card to the correct side in each time. If the written text on the card is the color of card itsel it has to be swiped to right and if it is different it has to be swiped to left.

## App Contains:
1. Swiping Card Mechanism
2. Transformation on Card during swiping
3. Score Label
4. Game Over Alert

## In this demo app I used and practiced:
1. UIPanGestureRecognizer
2. CGAffineTransform, Scaling and Rotiation
3. CGPoints, Centers and Coordinates
4. Shadows
5. Animation

I practiced this demo app for understanding the gesture recognizer for future projects in my mind.
